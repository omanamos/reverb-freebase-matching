But homicide investigators have questioned Peter John Mizioch or his associate Edward Maciag in three of the cases , as well as the 1979 shotgun wounding of another man on whom Mizioch 's company held a policy , according to police reports and court records .
In a sworn declaration filed last month in U.S. District Court , Mizioch , 70 , said he "absolutely had no involvement " in his wife 's death .
He declined an interview through his attorney , David W. Williams , who said suspicions about Mizioch are based solely on circumstantial information .
Tommy Thompson , a Phoenix police spokesman , denied that Mizioch has been named a suspect in his wife 's murder .
Ingram told detectives that Mizioch stood to profit from a $ 200,000 life-insurance policy .
Mizioch was questioned in that case .
Mizioch and Maciag filed lawsuits claiming that Bianchi and partner David Stark had defaulted on loans and owed upward of $ 2.3 million .
Mizioch 's friend and business associate , Maciag , was the named beneficiary for $ 1 million in life insurance .
Mizioch , a burly Boston-area native , spent nearly four decades building his Phoenix construction , waste-management and lending businesses .
On Oct. 14 , Mizioch filed a countersuit against Protective Life and his three stepchildren .
If he prevails , jurors could be asked to determine whether Mizioch is responsible for his wife 's death based on a preponderance of evidence , a lower burden than the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt .
