But from this desk in the tiny , concrete , Soviet-style apartment that he shares with his mother , grandmother , and two younger siblings in the Nile Delta village of Zowiya Ghazal , Kamel also helped launch one of the most momentous events in modern Middle East history : the revolution that toppled the 30-year-old dictatorship of President Hosni Mubarak .
Kamel represents that newly vocal sector of the Egyptian population that opposition parties have long referred to as the silent majority &# 151 ; but is now widely known as the Facebook generation .
More often , it was about anxiety over jobs and marriage , and a burning animosity toward a central authority and its foot soldiers that Kamel says treated him and others like creatures they could kick around and squash .
For a couple of years , Kamel blogged about his frustrations .
Kamel 's mother thought he was wasting his time .
Kamel took a train half-an-hour north to Alexandria with a small , new Kodak camera .
Last week , shortly after Kamel learned Ghonim 's identity for the first time , the two joined other activists on the popular Egyptian talk show " 10'o'clock at Night " to talk about how they &# 151 ; a bunch of unknowns &# 151 ; had helped launch a revolution .
It was a startling success for a silent majority that , Kamel insists , cares little about Egypt 's traditional political groups like the Muslim Brotherhood or the liberal Wafd party .
" There were a lot of people ready to do it , " Kamel says of his and other youth activists ' planning in the lead-up to the Jan . 25 protests , " But when they saw that the revolution in Tunisia succeeded , they realized that it was possible . "
