Erick recalled gradually working his way through increasingly difficult books , as Knopf helped him understand words he didn&# 39;t know .
A Reading Recovery specialist since 1998 and a teacher for 37 years , Knopf is helping 6-year-old Raquel Maldonado read about the ingenious way seagulls use gravity to feast on tough-to-crack shellfish .
Knopf said she takes the first two weeks of Reading Recovery just getting to know students so they feel comfortable .
After working through a few books , Knopf moved Raquel to a blackboard and instructed the young Silver Spring first-grader to arrange letters together on a blackboard , and then write certain letters .
Not content that Raquel could read through the books smoothly , Knopf also quizzed her about parts of the story to stress that reading simply is n&# 39;t about pronunciation and recognition of letters .
