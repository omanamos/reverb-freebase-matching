When they enter Reading Recovery , students cannot read &# 34;Level 1&# 34 ; material , such as the sentence &# 34;Mom is cooking &# 34 ; accompanied by a picture of a woman in a kitchen , said Linda Randall , a Reading Recovery teacher who also trains teachers in the program .
But she points out that Reading Recovery teachers share teaching strategies and observations of individual students with classroom teachers , ESOL specialists and staff developers .
In many cases , because the parents of Reading Recovery students have poor English skills , they end up learning to read and understand the language as their children do .
But Randall noted that many of those parents whose children benefit from Reading Recovery are more likely to work multiple jobs and less likely to be comfortable with English , and are therefore unlikely to protest cuts .
