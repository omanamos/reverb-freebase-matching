Mubarak&rsquo ;s Egypt , in a nutshell , was a quintessential neoliberal state .
First , Mubarak&rsquo ;s Egypt was considered to be at the forefront of instituting neoliberal policies in the Middle East .
The gist of Mitchell&rsquo ;s portrait of Egyptian neoliberalism was that while Egypt was lauded by institutions such as the International Monetary Fund as a beacon of free-market success , the standard tools for measuring economies gave a grossly inadequate picture of the Egyptian economy .
Egypt did not so much shrink its public sector , as neoliberal doctrine would have it , as it reallocated public resources for the benefit of a small and already affluent elite .

Mubarak&rsquo ;s Egypt degraded schools and hospitals , and guaranteed grossly inadequate wages , particularly in the ever-expanding private sector .

From the perspective of the 1970s , France produced the mother of all revolutions in the 1780s ; and we saw proto-typical phases in the French experience : the collapse of the old order , a period of constitutional reconstruction , counter-revolution , radicalization , terror , reaction , and a military dictatorship .
