We all live with stereotypes , and I admit and accept that many Americans have stereotypes of Egyptians or of Muslims , and I believe that many Egyptians and Muslims have stereotypes about the United States .
For true Muslims women will never have rights equal to men .
Whether by violence or by political means , Muslims want to rule the world according to their religion .
Protesters including diplomats , businessmen , actors , Christians and Muslims forced Mubarak out .
But they were quickly hushed by the large number of pious Muslims who had come to hear the imam .
He praised Muslims and Christians for standing together in Egypt 's revolution and even lauded the Coptic Christian &#8220;martyrs&#8221 ; who once fought the Romans and Byzantines .
We , in the west , are told that Muslims are murders and rapist ; if you only show violence in your country , you are reinforcing this lie .
