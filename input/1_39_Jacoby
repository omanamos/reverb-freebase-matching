But Jacoby is no Mr. Spock .
Jacoby sees a new ageism that does n&rsquo;t just stigmatize old people for their years , but blames them for physical ills that no lifestyle adjustments or medicine can yet forestall .
Jacoby also resurrects decades-old critiques of transactional analysis , EST and the Me Generation , and bemoans how today&rsquo ;s talk-show hosts , celebrity shrinks and medicine men pander to youth-obsessed fans .
Jacoby takes her younger self to task for once writing happy-talk articles on aging for AARP publications that rarely quoted anyone over 60 .
Boomers slightly younger than she is now , Jacoby observes , can imagine themselves easily enough as &ldquo;young old ,&rdquo ; but are not yet seasoned to empathize with the old old .
While Jacoby calls for big , preferably government-driven answers , the boomers she hopes to enlighten often turn to very local solutions for the age-related problems faced by their parents .
Friends , Jacoby writes , urged her to end the book with a positive note and some practical advice .
Yes , the brute facts are the brute facts , but &ldquo;Never Say Die&rdquo ; is ultimately &mdash ; as Jacoby acknowledges in an aside late in the book &mdash ; about her own fear of poverty , dementia and dependence .
