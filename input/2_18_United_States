The European Union and the United States could exert gentle influence through offers of economic and technical help .
The close relations that the United States enjoys with the Egyptian military make us a player , along with the annual $ 1.3 billion of support that funds military training and Egyptian purchase of U.S. military equipment .
And the United States supports the aspirations of the Egyptian people .
And let me say that I would respectfully suggest that the United States supported the aspirations of the Egyptian people .
And we are now working to try to promote that , reaching out to people who we think can play an important role going forward.And finally , I would say that I&rsquo ;m sure that part of the questions or the meaning of the questions from two young men is that the United States was a partner and ally of Egypt for many years .
Unfortunately , the United States was not able to bring that about .
I personally , because I was honored to be first lady and my husband was president , and now serving as Secretary of State in this capacity &ndash ; I personally know how strongly the United States did speak out on behalf of reforms , ending corruption , ending human rights abuses .
But the United States had nothing to do with the uprising , the revolution that we are now witnessing in Egypt .
So the United States supports a process .
His question is : Don&rsquo;t you think that the latest American veto was just a clear reminder that the United States loses any credibility as a fair and honest partner in the Middle East peace process ? Well , I hope not .
And the United States is ready to assist in any way that would be appropriate .
But major rethinking is seen as unlikely in the United States , whose strategic priority remains to help allies protect their oil and defend themselves against Iran .
