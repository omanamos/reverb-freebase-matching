The decision appeared to reflect that continued anxiety in Egypt about the country &rsquo ;s economic woes following 18 days of protests that toppled Hosni Mubarak were being compounded by broader unrest in the region .
Egypt 's military rulers have sworn in a new cabinet that includes 11 new ministers in a nod to the opposition movement that ousted Hosni Mubarak but that keeps three former members of the regime in key posts .
And as Hosni Mubarak found out just over a week ago , no address on state television is a match for the power of Facebook and Twitter .
It has been twelve days since Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president of the republic , and the country &#8212;although still celebrating &#8212 ;has never been more divided .
