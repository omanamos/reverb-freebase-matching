One pulled out a poster of Muammar Gadafy and the others gathered around it , some posing as if to kick Gadafy &#8217 ;s bloated visage , others pointing their rifles at his bespectacled eyes or dangling handcuffs in front .&#8220;Gadafy is a dog , Gadafy is a dog , &#8221 ; they yelled , jumping up and down .
Gadafy is still clinging to power and vowing bloody retribution .
Gadafy began his higher education at university in Benghazi , the heartland of the Libyan revolt led by Omar Mukhtar against Italy &#8217 ;s cruel colonial rule .
Gadafy established governance based on what he called &#8220;direct popular democracy &#8221 ; married to Muslim morality .
In 1972 , Gadafy pro- claimed a &#8220;Federation of Arab Republics &#8221 ; &#8211 ; combining Libya , Egypt and Syria .
Although there had been doubts about his responsibility for this atrocity , his defecting justice minister Mustafa Abul Jalil claimed this past week that Gadafy ordered the operation .
Gadafy was implicated in the 1989 bombing of a French civilian airliner over Chad that killed 170.During the 1990s , Libya suffered economic sanctions and diplomatic ostracism because Gadafy refused to permit the extradition to the US of the two Libyans accused of planting the bomb on the airliner .
