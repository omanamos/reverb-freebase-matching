She let Raquel choose between two books designed to test if she had made sufficient reading progress , and then briskly ticked off words Raquel pronounced correctly , noted where she had difficulty , and wrote down all the behavior that she observed .
As her Wednesday morning lesson proceeded and a timer on the table ticked away , Knopf was pleased to see that Raquel did not point at the words that she read .
After working through a few books , Knopf moved Raquel to a blackboard and instructed the young Silver Spring first-grader to arrange letters together on a blackboard , and then write certain letters .
Not content that Raquel could read through the books smoothly , Knopf also quizzed her about parts of the story to stress that reading simply is n&# 39;t about pronunciation and recognition of letters .
At the end of the 30-minute lesson , Raquel took several books to read for her homework .
