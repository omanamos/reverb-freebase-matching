No country knows this better than the birthplace of people power , the Philippines , which is celebrating its 25th anniversary this week .
1986 in the Philippines had many similarities to Egypt : Ferdinand Marcos , a U.S.-backed dictator in power for 21 years , was pushed out by more than two million people facing tanks and troops .
Spontaneously created , people power in the Philippines was triggered by a failed military coup ; the calls of the powerful Catholic Church to help the soldiers ; the journalists who risked their lives to get the message out ; alternative political figures who rallied around a widow , Corazon Aquino ; and the people who answered the call and came to the streets .
People power in the Philippines became a political tool , brandished by its people and its symbol , Corazon Aquino .
Figures from the Asian Development Bank show the Philippines is the only Southeast Asian nation to record an increase in the absolute number of poor people since 1990 .
On World Governance indicators -- Voice and Accountability , Political Stability , Government Effectiveness , Regulatory Quality , Rule of Law and Control of Corruption -- the Philippines actually slid backwards between 1998 and 2009 .
