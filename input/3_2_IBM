IBM has combined deep NLP with machine learning , a voting algorithm , a method of interpreting the questions and assessing them by formulating parallel hypotheses , and Hadoop and UIMA for preprocessing , as well as the usual search , fuzzy matching software and of course an in-memory caching system to save time in retrieval .
IBM 's Watson is a great example of harnessing the essence of search architecture , and combining it with other non-database technologies in order to tackle problems like answering questions not only for Jeopardy , but also for detecting patterns and suggesting solutions in healthcare , terrorism detection , fraud detection , or reputation monitoring and risk mitigation .
" After multiple iterations of loading and testing and loading and testing and updating the database on SONAS , IBM came up with a version of the database of that would generate the data set that got loaded into memory . "
IBM began eying the medical marketplace more than 45 years ago .
From what I know the next step envisioned by IBM is to make a version of Watson tailored to the healthcare domain .
IBM is a leader in the middleware business with a nearly 50 % market share .
With advancements in its data analysis and information management software capabilities , as displayed by Watson on Jeopardy , IBM can further extend its dominance in the middleware software market against competitors like Oracle and Red Hat .
We currently estimate that IBM ’s middleware license revenues will increase from roughly $ 5.5 billion in 2010 to $ 10.3 billion in 2017 .
However , if IBM can capture greater market share due to software advancements , and middleware license revenues accelerate towards $ 14 billion ( vs .
I would expect that the IBM one would be much better since their computer has so much more power .
Over the past five years , IBM has slashed costs , taken on debt and bought back millions of shares .
IBM , though , is stuck in neutral .
But let’s briefly consider two things ; what it means for companies in IBM ’s ecosystem , and what it implies about the emerging era of intuitive computing and The Cloud.The last time IBM pulled off a similar stunt was several computer generations ago – the globally-watched 1997 chess match between Big Blue and chess master Gary Kasparov.
IBM has an obligation to tell investors what they think the future looks like for their technology .
And surely a Saturday Night Live Jeopardy spoof will emerge too , perhaps getting Darrell Hammond back to pit his IBM is one of the few still-standing companies from the Jurassic Era of computing with its roots starting , amazingly enough , before WWI and pre-dating even the first era of modern computing .
There is no convention in how to denote eras in the history of computing , but the emergence of each great cycle has been associated with telegraphic names – and IBM has been there for all of them .
The subsequent rise of mainframes , in which IBM not UNIVAC proceeded to dominate , took IBM stock up over 400 percent over the following decade or so. With the names Apple and Superbowl in 1984 , we saw the second great cycle in computing – the era of the desktop made possible by the microprocessor .
IBM took a few years to get their rhythm in that cycle to come up with a competitive desktop PC , and then dominated .
IBM stock ran up another 400 percent or so in the decade or so following that era’s launch .
That’s what IBM properly brags about in the Watson project .
Whether IBM experiences another 400 percent decade-long rise in its stock value may be too much to expect in this cycle , but it ’s not crazy .
By building your own Watson Jr. , you can understand the process of what IBM went through to make this machine .
On Tuesday , February 15 , 2011 IBM came to Clarkson 's Student Center to show off their new toy : the IBM computer known as Watson , who was created to compete against well-known Jeopardy contestants .

Kasparov accused IBM of cheating in the match and requested a rematch but was denied .
And IBM can be lauded for these experiments .
Things were different in 1997 , when IBM ’s Deep Blue took on world chess champ Gary Kasparov.
Kasparov demanded to see Deep Blue’s analysis for the crucial move , but IBM refused and dismantled the computer .
I’m on the record saying that IBM ’s acquisition of BNT is not to attack Cisco .
With the beta version of the Watson software , IBM started out with a few racks of its BlueGene/P parallel supercomputers , a grandson of the Deep Blue RS/6000 SP PowerParallel machine that played a chess tournament against Gary Kasparov – and beat him – back in 1997 .
To have enough memory and bandwidth to store all the necessary data , IBM put 90 of these Power 750 servers into ten server racks .
IBM will donate all its winnings to charity , while the humans plan to give away half .
On Feb. 14 , IBM 's artificial intelligence computer system , Watson , made an appearance on the TV game show , Jeopardy !
IBM has good intentions with their technology , but too much technological advancement is not always a good thing .
Granted , IBM invested tons of time into the supercomputer , but still .
