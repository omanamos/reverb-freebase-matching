Are Khaled Said &#8221 ; Facebook page showed up within 5 days of Said &#8217 ;s death in June and served as a hub for dissidence against Egyptian police brutality as well as a way to disseminate logistical information about the escalating anti-government protests until Mubarak&#8217 ;s resignation .
" This is basically Khaled 's life , " says Amal Abdel Maguid , pointing to a narrow twin-size bed crammed into a corner next to a desk with a hulking HP desktop computer on it .
Google exec Wael Ghonim helped mobilise the masses with his " We Are Khaled Said " Facebook page - named in honour of the young man who was beaten to death by police outside an Alexandria internet cafe last June .
Khaled told his sister he planned to set up a website about police corruption and post the video .
An autopsy , dismissed as a cover-up by the family , concluded Khaled had died of asphyxiation after swallowing a packet of drugs .
On June 12 , the ministry of the interior issued a statement claiming Khaled had been convicted in absentia of theft and illegal possession of weapons .
