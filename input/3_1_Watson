To have any chance of getting in when Watson knows the answer , the humans have to guess when the light will appear and be incredibly lucky .
By the end of the competition , Watson had roughly triple the amount of Ken , its nearest human rival .
Of course , Watson still had to sift through this information , which it did in most cases quite well .
Still , on many rather basic questions , Watson either didn&rsquo;t have enough confidence to hazard a guess or it replied incorrectly .
All contestants on Jeopardy , Watson included , need to wait until Alex Trebek is finished reading to ring in .
He replied that sometimes humans could ring in a millisecond after they were allowed to , and that Watson couldn&rsquo;t do this .

But because the Watson effort was not just a technical challenge , but also a killer marketing campaign for the current Power7-based Power Systems lineup , Big Blue eventually switched the Watson DeepQA software stack to a cluster of Power 750 midrange servers .
The 90 servers underpinning the Watson machine had a combined 16TB of main memory , but it looks like that was not evenly distributed across the nodes .
IBM did not say if it was disk drives or flash , but if most of the data used by Watson is stored in main memory , there is no reason to use the more expensive flash technology .
Watson defeated them both , with a first-prize win of $ 1 million .
Anyone who fears that Watson is dead set on world domination can relax .
Watson wants to help us , not destroy us .

Watson has a database that contains millions of documents .
When a patient comes in with a mysterious set of symptoms the doctors can’t figure out , Watson would quickly sort through hundreds of medical dictionaries , academic studies , and encyclopedias and come up with a list of diagnosis possibilities .
Watson could come in handy for the police , pharmaceutical labs , hospitals and anywhere else that requires the processing of vast amounts of data .
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IBM &#8217 ;s computer program Watson defeated former &#8220;Jeopardy ! &#8221 ; champs Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter last week , winning $ 1 million that will go to charity .
The Watson team is going to need to make the transition to an environment in which it comes up with multiple hypotheses &#8212 ; it will be a really interesting challenge for the team to be able to do that .&#8221;Siegel said it would likely be at least two years before Watson will be used on patients at his hospital .
Watson competed against the biggest all-time money winner on the show , Brad Rutter , along with the record holder for longest championship series , Ken Jennings .
Why we even have " thinking computers " like IBM 's Watson winning at Jeopardy , and making us wonder if Watson may someday turn out to be the infamous HAL from " 2001 : A Space Odyssey . "
Now , Watson has the title of &quot;doctor ,&quot ; and he 's going to college .
