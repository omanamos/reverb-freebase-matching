Grady and county officials remain at odds over how to calculate the amount Fulton taxpayers&nbsp;should subsidize treatment for indigent and uninsured Fulton residents .
This year , Grady faces a $ 25 million &nbsp;reduction in federal indigent care funding and plans 100 layoffs , with a possibility of program cuts that have n't been specified .
Whenever Grady comes up on the commission , discussions devolve into angry rhetoric and accusations , with Edwards and Emma&nbsp;Darnell charging that hospital officials have n't upheld their end of the bargain and criticizing colleagues for placating them .
Pitts and Commissioner Tom Lowe have suggested that , to end the bickering , the county just come up with a dollar figure for Grady every year , then divide it by 12 and cut checks every month .
John Sherman , president of the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation and a Grady board member in the late 1990s , said he does n't think the county gives too much to the hospital .
Final 2010 numbers are n't available yet , but Gove said that through the end of November , Grady had $ 590.7 million in expenses and brought in $ 503.3 million in revenue .
