One possible outcome is a merger between T-Mobile , Sprint and Clearwire that would forge a significant third U.S. cellular operator with a 30 % market share to match similar shares controlled by ATT and Verizon . "
Clearwire is an example of the latter problem .
Now , Clearwire does n’t have sufficient billions to complete its network beyond the 120 million population units it now covers .
In contrast , Clearwire added 1.5 million total customers in the December quarter .
That is not chump change so the ability to carry its own traffic on a captive network would be important going forward.The relationship between Clearwire and Sprint has been an uncomfortable marriage to say the least .
Clearwire does have 6 CLEAR retail stores and a tiny retail business .
Sprint and Clearwire have been at loggerheads over issues including the payment schedule that would pertain to Sprint’s Smartphone use of the Clearwire network .
Once announced , it is likely that Clearwire will collect more revenues from Sprint than it already has collected and recorded for 2010 .
The additional revenues to Clearwire which were not included in revenues for 2010 would be reported in 2011 .
