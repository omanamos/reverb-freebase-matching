Aldawsari retained criminal defense attorney Rod Hobson , who issued a statement saying that &quot;the eyes of the world are on this case and the treatment of this accused person ,&quot ; the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported .
Unlike in a number of recent arrests of suspected terrorism plotters , however , authorities said that Aldawsari had managed to advance his plans and assemble some of the ingredients for a bomb before the FBI became aware of him .
Officials said that Aldawsari appeared to be acting alone and was not in touch with any terrorist organization overseas .
Aldawsari first studied English as a second language at Vanderbilt University in Nashville .
Aldawsari , whose education was funded by a Saudi corporation , wrote that he worked hard to excel in high school so he could get a scholarship to study in the United States .
A Saudi official said Aldawsari had drawn no attention before his arrest .
The affidavit alleges that Aldawsari also e-mailed himself instructions on how to convert a cellular phone into a remote detonator and how to prepare a booby-trapped vehicle using items available in every home .
A spokeswoman said that Aldawsari was a transfer student who had been at their college for only six weeks .
