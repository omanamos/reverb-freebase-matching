Watson&rsquo ;s calculations indicate great trouble is ahead for your country .
In the end , though , the competition turned out to be a bit of a yawner , as Watson&rsquo ;s supremacy was never seriously in doubt .
This was most apparent with Watson&rsquo ;s Final Jeopardy response of &ldquo ; What is Toronto ?&rdquo ; for a clue where the category was &ldquo;U.S. cities ,&rdquo ; though there were quite a few other examples as well .
After the beta test was over , I pointed out Watson&rsquo ;s inherently unfair advantage on the buzzer to David Ferrucci , the chief scientist on the project .
This may be true , but humans can also ring in much later or too early , whereas Watson&rsquo ;s consistently excellent timing was beyond human capability .
