The issue wo n't really get cleared up much here this weekend , because Gabbert has chosen -- or more accurately , his agent Tom Condon , has chosen for him -- not to throw in Sunday 's QB workouts .
The buzz may be building on behalf of Auburn 's Cam Newton as the first quarterback taken , and maybe even the No. 1 overall pick ; but plenty of draft analysts seem to believe that Gabbert has more pieces of the puzzle in place than any other quarterback prospect .
But he has concerns about that footwork that Gabbert seems to think is no problem , and it again goes back to the spread offense versus an under-center style of quarterbacking .
Gabbert 's feet may be a work in progress , but this much came through loud and clear during his chat with the media : He 's good at math .
Gabbert is the only quarterback not throwing at the combine .
Gabbert is following the CAA formula .
Teams would probably love to see Gabbert throw in Indy , but quarterbacks with enough clout have avoided throwing in Indy for over a decade .
Gabbert threw over 36 passes per game .
