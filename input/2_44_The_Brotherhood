The Brotherhood will form a political party .
The Brotherhood played an important , but not leading , role in the recent protests .
The Brotherhood was founded by Hasan al Banna in 1928 , when Egyptian politics and economy was still dominated by Britain , despite nominal independence in 1922 .
The Brotherhood and other political groups have called for another million-man-march tomorrow to fill Cairoâ€™s central Tahrir Square .
The Brotherhood took four days to join the protest , and political Islam was not a significant theme in the demands protesters made to the regime .
