So what First Amendment lessons can those in Cairo take from America &#x92 ;s ongoing experiment as a free nation ?
My question is : Does America really support democracy ?
It is not hard to see that America has already gone a long way down that dark path .
Just as America was the New World , from a European expansionist perspective , the New Free World is taking apart the other side of the Iron Curtain .
It was widely believed that Gamal , who formerly worked for Bank of America in London , was being groomed for succession as he spent the last few years working within Egypt 's former ruling National Democratic Party .
On the other hand , America has spent American blood , spilled even more Iraqi blood , and $ 700 billion , in an attempt to bring democracy to Iraq.For all the brand identification that Washington takes from the word , democracy , Washington is nevertheless shy of admitting that in Gaza democracy means Hamas .
