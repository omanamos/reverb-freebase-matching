And nobody ever confused it with a distant , imaginary sequel to a Tom Hanks film from 1995 .Happily , though , Apollo 18 is ready to swoop in and correct all of these flaws .
This is because Apollo 18 is about 's discontinued moon-landing programme .
The premise is this : why did Nasa never return to the moon after Apollo 17 ? Is it because of exorbitant operational costs , dwindling public interest and a new focus on developing reusable exploration technologies like you thought ?
Apollo 18 is clearly a schlocky genre film that looks perfectly acceptable and quite innovative in its own little world .
Anyway , apparently its one of those where you really have to watch Apollo 18 to be able to understand what 's going on in the second one .
The real story of Apollo is far more exciting than this guff .
Apollo 11 was the first mission to put people on the moon .
Apollo 13 did n't touch down on the moon .
So how the hell can Apollo 18 be the 18th mission ?

As for how the footage gets back to earth , perhaps the also-secret Apollo 19 did a pick-up .
