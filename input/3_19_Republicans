Republicans contend the cuts must be made to slow the growth of the national debt .
Perhaps Republicans could take a more long-term view of some of these projects and see that they actually do help the Republican agenda by actually promoting so-called &ldquo;Republican ideals&rdquo ; of helping small and big business to advance .

Incidentally , the Republicans are also cutting NOAA , which monitors hurricanes , by $ 336 million ; the EPA 's budget by $ 1.6 billion ; the EPA Energy Star program by $ 7.4 million ; the EPA 's GHG Reporting Registry by $ 9 million ; the US Global Survey by $ 27 million ; the EPA 's Cap and Trade Technical Assistance by $ 5 million ; the EPA 's State and Local Air Quality Management by $ 25 million ; and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund by a massive $ 700 million .
While the Republicans are attacking public employees , including state troopers and other public safety offices at the state level , Congress cut their federal budgets , too .
In a way , the Republicans cut the budget for the Constitution -- a document in which tea party people are showing some serious interest .
Republicans should be commended for their willingness to cast a vote that will fix this budget and future budgets .
