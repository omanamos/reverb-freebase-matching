Then again , Mr. Stein , 37 , is a proud throwback .
Wearing a slim gray suit and humming with nervous energy , Mr. Stein was ready to embark on a few hours of ambitious party-hopping : a book party in TriBeCa for his friend , the cross-dressing literary sensation Jon-Jon Goulian ; a Harper&rsquo ;s magazine event attended by the writer <a href= "http ://topics .nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/zadie_smith/index .html ?inline=nyt-per " title =" More articles about Zadie Smith . "
Last spring , Mr. Stein was anointed the new editor of The Paris Review , only the third to hold the title in the magazine&rsquo ;s 58-year history , and the second to follow , himself a legendary New York social figure .
But Mr. Stein , who translates books from French , studied poetry as a graduate student and helped edit <a href= "http ://topics .nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/f/jonathan_franzen/index .html ?inline=nyt-per " title =" More articles about Jonathan Franzen . "
Since Mr. Stein began as editor last April , his office has been a place where publishers and authors drop by at the end of a workday for gossip and a drink , where guests wander in during packed Paris Review soirees and where , not long ago , the employees of a creative marketing firm downstairs gathered for an impromptu late-night party .
When Mr. Stein marched into the job last year , he came with heavy-duty connections .
The list of writers Mr. Stein counts as friends includes Sam Lipsyte and the poet Frederick Seidel , whose enormous black-and-white portrait &mdash ; taken in the photo booth at the Lakeside Lounge on Avenue B &mdash ; hangs in the Paris Review bathroom .
So far , Mr. Stein seems to be handling both the social and the professional job requirements rather deftly .
Little more than a half-hour later , Mr. Stein threw on his coat and burst out the door .
