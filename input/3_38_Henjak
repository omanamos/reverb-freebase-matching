Henjak was this week bucked by the Broncos with indecent haste or almost comical slowness depending on how you look at it .
The Broncos waited until 18 days before the start of the NRL season to dump Henjak , who had spent two years living in the shadow of former coach Wayne Bennett .
For what it 's worth , I do n't think many league watchers believed Henjak was the man who would lead the Broncos to old heights .
As strange sackings in our backyard go , Henjak 's demise is a stunner to match the 2004 saga involving Brumbies rugby coach David Nucifora .
Henjak 's Broncos severance deal is said to include a gagging clause .
